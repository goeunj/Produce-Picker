Scrum Master: Goeun

Product Owner: Jacob

Team Member: Dayne

Repo Manager: Sparsh

We all had to fill in for Sparsh as they were MIA for the whole iteration.


A note for marking:

One of our team members was having issues running the game without crashing but on my end, everything works fine. If this is the case for whoever's marking, I would be more than happy
to record me running the game to prove it works.

Since we were down a team member for the whole iteration we did not have the time to get the new high-scores page done.

Thank you
